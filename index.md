#### A Little Bit About Me

## Nice to Meet You...

```
class Greetings {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hi! I'm Sam, nice to meet you!"); 
    }
}
```

Hi, my name is *Samuel Kent* but I mainly go by [Sam](IMG_5870.JPG).
I grew up in the mountains of [Big Bear](https://www.bigbear.com/) with my
parents and two brothers. I used to play basketball and baseball for the highschool
but once I graduated I shifted more towards weight lifting and [waterskiing](Sam%20Slomo.mp4).
Besides those, my current hobbies include:
- Reading
- Music
- Archery
- Movies
- Skateboarding(just for cruising sake)

## My Programming

As a programmer, I try to write the most efficient code I can but I think
I still have ways to go. I'm always open to hearing about ways to speed up my code
or any other improvements. I've worked with data structures such as BST's, hash tables,
multiway tries, and others in class and on my own I've messed around with purmutations and
working on problems from the [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/archives), if you haven't
heard of this, I highly suggest it. In terms of doing projects, I try to plan out what I'm going 
to do at least a little bit but most of my projects have followed more in the words of *Hermann Goering* 
> Shoot first and ask questions later...
When I run into problems in the **ask questions later** portion, I'm a big fan of drawing things 
out and running tests.
As of right now, the languages I know well from most favorite to least:
1. Java
2. C++
3. C

I know that's not a lot but I have plans to learn more:
- [X] Java
- [X] C++
- [X] C
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Any others of importance I'm missing
